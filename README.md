# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher Script
This script implements a simple Caesar Cipher that allows users to both encrypt and decrypt messages. The cipher shifts each letter in the message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet while leaving non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, numbers, or punctuation) unchanged.

Key Features:
Encryption/Decryption: Users can select whether they want to encrypt or decrypt their message by providing the shift value and mode ('encrypt' or 'decrypt').
Handles Both Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: Uppercase and lowercase letters are shifted independently and correctly, maintaining the case of each letter.
Input Flexibility: The script processes alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, keeping non-alphabetic characters as they are.
Example Usage:
The script prompts the user to input a message, shift value, and mode ('encrypt' or 'decrypt').
It then shifts the letters accordingly and prints the encrypted or decrypted message.
